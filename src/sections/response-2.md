# Notifications Response # {#notifications-response}

<!--

In response to a `GET` request with a =Accept-Events= header field with `PREP` as the preferred notifications protocol, a resource server providing notifications:

+ MUST respond with a status code identical to the one that would have been sent with the response had notifications not been requested.
+ MUST include the message body that would have been transmitted had notifications not been requested, unless the `Prefer` header field {{RFC7240}} indicates a preference of `return=minimal` ({{RFC7240 Section 4.2}}).

-->

## Common Headers ## {#notifications-response-common-headers}

A resource server providing notifications using the {{&protocol}}:

+ MUST include the following header fields in the response:

  + `Date` ({{HTTP, Section 6.6.1}}).
  + `Content-Type` ({{HTTP, Section 8.3}}) with the media type set to `multipart` ({{HTTP, Section 8.3.3}}). The subtype will depend on whether the base response is included in the response body.
  + =Events= which MUST include the following event fields:
    + `protocol` set to the value `PREP`.
    + `status` set to the `200 (OK)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.1}}) status code.
    + `expires` with an integer value in seconds indicating an interval after `Date` when notifications will no longer be sent and the response stream is closed.

    NOTE: Since caching is meaningless in the context of notifications, this specifications repurposes the deprecated `Expires` header field to specify when the notifications response ends.

+ SHOULD include the following header fields in the response:

  + `Vary` ({{HTTP, Section 12.5.5}}) which MUST include =Accept-Events= as one of the values.
  + `Last-Modified` ({{HTTP, Section 8.8.2}}).
  + `ETag` ({{HTTP, Section 8.8.3}}).

+ MAY include the following header fields in the response:

  + =Accept-Events= which MUST list `PREP` as one of the available notification protocols. Associated with the `PREP` list item, the resource server:
    + MUST include an `accept` event field with at least one acceptable media-type for notifications.

## Only Notifications ## {#only-notifications-response}

An application client requesting only notifications using the {{&protocol}} needs to explicitly opt out of receiving the base response as described in {{request}}.

A resource server MUST NOT send the base response, if the request for PREP notifications includes the `Last-Event-ID` header field ({{SSE}}, [Section 9.2.4](SSE#the-last-event-id-header)) which matches the `Event-ID` of the last event on the resource.

### Headers ### {#only-notifications-response-headers}

A resource server that provides only notifications using the {{&protocol}} MUST include the `Vary` header field ({{HTTP, Section 12.5.5}}) with `Last-Event-ID` as one of the values.

### Body ### {#only-notifications-response-body}

A resource server MUST transmit PREP notifications as a multipart message body ({{RFC2046, Section 5.1}}), with a media type of `multipart/digest` ({{RFC2046, Section 5.1.5}}) that MAY include zero or more body parts. Each body part of the multipart message body MAY contain at most one notification.

{:aside}
> **Implementation Guidance**
>
> While not strictly necessary, it is strongly encouraged that resource servers send notifications in a manner such that the boundary delimiter ({{RFC2046, Section 5.1.2}}) is always at the end of a chunk ({{-HTTP1, Section 7.1}}) or data frame ({{-HTTP2, Section 6.1}}) as shown in the example above. This way an application client does not have to wait until the next chunk or frame (which might be a while or in cases of error never arrive) to be certain that the immediate message is complete.


## Composite Response ## {#composite-response}

By default, the {{&protocol}} requires a resource server to transmit the base response body before notifications. An application client MAY opt out of this behaviour as described in {{request}}.

NOTE: Not only does this behaviour ensure interoperability, it is also desirable in most scenarios. It short-circuits an extra round trip that would be otherwise needed to fetch the current representation before notifications and eliminates the need to co-ordinate the two responses.

### Headers ### {#composite-response-headers}

If the request for PREP notifications includes the `Last-Event-ID` header field, a resource server MUST include `Vary` header field ({{HTTP, Section 12.5.5}}) with `last-event-id` as one of the values.

### Body ### {#composite-response-body}

Where the response includes a base response body prior to PREP notifications, a resource server MUST transmit a multipart message body ({{RFC2046, Section 5.1}}) with a media type of `multipart/mixed` ({{RFC2046, Section 5.1.3}}) with two body parts in the order specified below:

1. the message body that would have been sent had notifications not been requested.
2. the multipart response body with body parts containing notifications as defined in {{only-notifications-response}}.

## Termination ## {#notifications-response-termination}

A resource server MUST end the notification response in any one of the following scenarios:

+ Once the time specified in the `expires` parameter of the =Events= header field has elapsed.
+ Immediately after sending a notification upon a `DELETE` request on the resource that results in a response with `200 (OK)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.1}}) or `204 (No Content)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.5}}) status codes.

A resource server MUST properly terminate the multipart response as defined in {{RFC2046, Section 5.1.2}}, before closing the notification response stream.

> **Implementation Guidance**
>
> When a user navigates away from a website or an application using PREP notifications, application clients are strongly encouraged to properly close the response stream to ensure that servers do not keep sending notifications.
