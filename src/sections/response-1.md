# Process

1. Calculate Base Response R
2. Does the resource provide notifications?
   No -> return R
3. Does the request have an =Accept-Events= header?
   No -> return R
4. Can the =Accept-Events= header be Parsed?
   No -> return R
5. Loop: Can you identify a preferred protocol?
   No -> return R
6. Do you support the Preferred protocol?
   No -> Reject Preference; GOTO 5
7. Can you serve notifications with that protocol?
   No -> Set Events header with protocol and any failed status; GOTO 5
8. Serve with protocol

Step 7. For PREP Protocol
0. Does the response R allow for Notifications
   No -> Failed Status: 412 (Precondition Failed)
1. Does the RS understand the event fields
   No -> Failed Status: 400
2. Can RS serve notifications consistent with event fields
   No -> Failed Status: 403, 406
3. Calculate notifications N headers
4. Does `last-event-id` exist and match?
   No -> send R headers + N headers + R body
   Yes -> send R headers + N headers
6. Loop: Has time elapsed?
   Yes -> GOTO 10
7. Has there been an event?
   No -> GOTO 6
8. Send Notifications;
9. Is the event Delete;
   No -> GOTO 6
10. Close Stream

# Response without Notifications # {#response-without-notifications}

## Not Available ## {#response-when-notifications-not-available}

A resource server not implementing the {{&protocol}} (or not supporting it for the target resource) can ignore a request for notifications and respond as if it received a normal request on that resource without impacting interoperability.

A resource server that does not provide notifications using the {{&protocol}} MUST NOT:

+ list `PREP` as as one of the available protocols in the =Accept-Events= header field, if sent in the response.
+ send the =Events= header field in the response with the `protocol` event field set to `PREP`.

{:aside}
> **Implementation Guidance**
>
> Implementations are advised against sending notifications for long-lived resources. A resource might be considered long-lived, if the resource server determines that the resource is unlikely to change in the duration of the notification response. In such instances, resource servers are strongly advised to respond with the `Cache-Control` header and set the `max-age` parameter in it.

## Error Response ## {#error-response}

A resource server MUST NOT include PREP notifications in a response, unless request results in one of the following status codes:

+ `200 (OK)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.1}}),
+ `204 (No Content)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.5}}),
+ `206 (Partial Content)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.7}}),
+ `226 (IM Used)` ({{Delta, Section 10.4.1}}).

A resource server that does not serve PREP notifications, on account of the response not having one of the above-mentioned status codes:

+ SHOULD include the =Events= header fields where:
  + the `protocol` event field MUST be set to a value of `PREP`,
  + the `status` event field MUST be set to `412 (Precondition Failed)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.5.13}}) status code.

## Notification Errors ## {#response-with-notification-errors}

A resource server might still not be able to send notifications using the {{&protocol}} requested by an application client despite a valid response.

A resource server unable to serve PREP notifications, even when the request results in a status code mentioned in {{error-response}}:

+ SHOULD include the =Events= header fields in the response where:
  + the `protocol` event field MUST be set to a value of `PREP`,
  + the `status` event field MUST be set to appropriate  status code indicating the reason for not serving notifications.
