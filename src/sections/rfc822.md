# Semantics for `message/rfc822` notifications # {#rfc822-semantics}

The `multipart/digest` multipart media-type ({{RFC2046, Section 5.1.5}}) uses `message/rfc822` media-type ({{RFC2046, Section 5.2.1}}, {{RFC822}}) for body parts as default. It follows that the {{&protocol}} transmits notifications as `message/rfc822`, unless the application client requests otherwise.

## Request ## {#rfc822-request}

An application clients MAY specify additional parameters to `message/rfc822` notification media-type in the `accept` event field associated with the `PREP` list item in the =Accept-Events= header field of the request.

## Notification ## {#rfc822-notification}

A resource server implementing the {{&protocol}} SHOULD send a notification to an application client when a request with one of the following methods on a resource:

+ `POST` ({{HTTP, Section 9.3.3}}),
+ `PUT` ({{HTTP, Section 9.3.4}}),
+ `PATCH` ({{RFC5789}}),
+ `DELETE` ({{HTTP, Section 9.3.5}}).

generates one of the following status codes:

+ `200 (OK)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.1}}),
+ `201 (Created)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.2}}),
+ `204 (No Content)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.5}}).

The notification MUST NOT be sent before the success response has been sent to the user agent that initiated the request.

## Headers ## {#rfc822-headers}

A resource server MUST include the following header fields in a `message/rfc822` formatted PREP notification:

`Method`
: identical to `:method` pseudo-header field in a HTTP/2 request ({{-HTTP2, Section 8.3.1}}), that specifies the request method that triggered the notification.

`Date`
: identical to `Date` header field in a HTTP response ({{HTTP, Section 6.6.1}}), that specifies date and time at which the event that triggered the notification was completed.

`Event-ID`
: an opaque identifier for the generated notification.

A resource server SHOULD include the following headers in a `message/rfc822` formatted PREP notification when the state of the resource or its representation is modified as a result of the event:

`ETag`
: identical to `ETag` header field ({{HTTP, Section 8.8.3}}) in a HTTP response, that is an opaque identifier for the current representation of the state of the resource.

A resource server MUST include the following headers in a `message/rfc822` formatted PREP notification when sent as a result of a `POST` request that modifies another resource:

`Content-Location`
: identical to the `Content-Location` header field ({{HTTP, Section 8.7}}).

*[delta representation]: (((delta representation)))
*[delta representations]: (((delta representation)))
## Body ## {#rfc822-body}

The body of a `message/rfc822` formatted PREP notification might be used to provide a (((!delta representation))), the difference between the state of the representation before and after the most recent event on the resource.

If the application client does not specify `delta` parameter associated with a preferred notifications format of `message/rfc822` in the `accept` event field of the {{request}} that results in `message/rfc822` formatted PREP notifications, the notifications MUST NOT contain a body.

If the application client specifies a (`delta`) parameter associated with a preferred notifications format of `message/rfc822` in the `accept` event field of the {{request}} that results in `message/rfc822` formatted PREP notifications, a resource server SHOULD send the delta representation as the body of the notification when a request with one of the following methods on a resource:

+ `POST` ({{HTTP, Section 9.3.3}}),
+ `PUT` ({{HTTP, Section 9.3.4}}),
+ `PATCH` ({{RFC5789}}),

generate one of the following status codes:

+ `200 (OK)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.1}}),
+ `201 (Created)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.2}}),
+ `204 (No Content)` ({{HTTP, Section 15.3.5}}).

A resource server SHOULD send the delta representation in the content-type preferred by the client as specified by the `delta` parameter.

<!--
  If a `delta` parameter is not set in the `content-type` event field for the [[#notifications-response]], resource servers MUST provide a `Content-Type` header in each notification.
