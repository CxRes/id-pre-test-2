This is the *Internet Draft* of the **Per Resource Events** Protocol.

**Per Resource Events** is a minimal protocol built on top of HTTP that allows clients to receive notifications directly from any resource of interest in a secure manner.

The **Per Resource Events** Protocol is predicated on the idea that the most intuitive source for notifications about changes made to a resource is the resource itself.
